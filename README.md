## 🌍 About Me

With over **four decades of experience** at the intersection of technology, governance, and environmental systems, I specialize in designing and reasoning about complex sociotechnical and ecological systems, scaling from organizations to cities, nations, and the globe.

I have pioneered dynamic system models, feedback-based governance frameworks, and intervention strategies for public, private, and academic stakeholders. My leadership capacity-building and strategic foresight advisory work is recognized internationally, including by the World Economic Forum, for advancing systems modeling, public policy, and governance innovation.

## 🧠 What I Do

- **System Modeling & Reasoning**  
  Architecting dynamic, actor-based, and life-cycle models to enable evidence-driven decision-making.

- **Strategic Foresight & Transformation**  
  Advising governments, businesses, and academia on high-stakes, rapidly evolving challenges.

- **AI & Logic Programming**  
  Advancing causal inference from narrative text using LLMs and custom GPTs, integrating modern AI with legacy expert systems, systems simulation, and modeling.

- **Leadership & Capacity Building**  
  Developing frameworks and tools for leadership-ready systemic interventions.
